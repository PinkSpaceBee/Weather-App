# Weather-App

TO-DO
------
-JS-
1. Round deg numbers, e. g. 31.75 => 32 -DONE-
2. Display pop in percents -DONE-
3. Switch bg mode (day/night) depending on the time of day
4. Switch between hourly and daily display ?? idk if it's neccessary
5. fix ya floats, bc rn the chance of rain in odesa is 28.000000004% lol
5. ok so when I send an innapropriate query the app displays the defaul weather forecasr, i. e. for kyiv, but the hourly section is empty (daily works how it's supposed to)
